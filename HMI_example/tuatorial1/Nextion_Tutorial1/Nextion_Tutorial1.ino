/* 
The following sketch is an example of how to send data to the Nextion display without any library.

The data can be text, numbers, or any other atribute of an object.

You can also send System Variables to change settings on the display like: brightness, serial baud rate, etc.

Connection with Arduino Uno/Nano:
* +5V = 5V
* TX  = none
* RX  = pin 1 (TX)
* GND = GND


This sketch was made for my 1st video tutorial shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIWxSLVAAQE

void setup() {  // Put your setup code here, to run once:
  
  Serial.begin(9600);  // Start serial comunication at baud=9600. For Arduino mega you would have to add a
                       // number (example: "Serial1.begin(9600);").
                       // If you use an Arduino mega, you have to also edit everything on this sketch that
                       // says "Serial" and replace it with "Serial1" (or whatever number you are using).

  Serial.print("baud=38400");  // Set new baud rate of nextion to 38400, but is temporal. Next time nextion is
                               // power on, it will retore to default baud of 9600.
